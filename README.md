# Bandage E-Commerce Store


Introducing a user-friendly e-commerce website with a minimalist design. Our platform features two main pages: the Homepage and the Product Details page. The Homepage showcases a dynamic product list, sourced from an API, alongside static content. The Product Details page offers comprehensive information about each product. Users can add items to their cart or wishlist, with data persisting even after refreshing or reopening the page. Our website also includes convenient popups for the cart and wishlist. We prioritize accuracy, code discipline, and cleanliness, striving for high-quality implementation and excellent Lighthouse scores.
